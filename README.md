# House Price Prediction

# Overview
An end-to-end Machine Learning project predicting California house prices using demographic and geographic data.  
The project covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression models (Linear & Random Forest) and visualizations.  
Deliverables include dataset, notebook, report, and presentation for business-ready insights.

# Dataset
Source: California Housing Dataset (Kaggle)  
Size: 20,640 rows × 10 columns  
Features: demographics, housing details, income, location  
Target: median_house_value  

# Approach
1. Preprocessing: handled missing values, standardized features, encoded categories  
2. Feature Engineering: added `bedroom_ratio` and `household_rooms`  
3. Modeling:
   - Linear Regression → R² = 0.65  
   - Random Forest → R² = 0.82 (better performance)  
4. Visualization: correlation heatmap, geographic maps, feature importance  

# Results
1. Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression  
2. Feature engineering improved model accuracy  
3. Insights support real estate buyers, sellers, and investors  

# Tech Stack
1.Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
2.Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
3.Tools: Jupyter Notebook, PowerPoint, Word
